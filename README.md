## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles

### What I learned

This was a wonderful project to really grind the styling with tailwind and CSS.
It was a good practice for managing states which really drove home the concepts of how components interact with each other.
